## Hackaton

### The theme

- We were on a random planet in the Solar system and we had to communicate with Earth through a MQTT protocol and send them the temperature, humidity and acceleration.
- The display has a minimum of two screens od which one had to bi a funcional Tic,Tac,Toe game so an alien could play with someon on Earth.

### What is working?

- The station is connected to Wifi and the temperature and humidity sensor is working and sending the values to the server through the MQTT protocol.
- The SOS signaling with LED and buzzer is funcional. You have to use two buttons to start and stop the signaling.
- There are two screens, on the second one is the unfinished Tic,tac,toe game
